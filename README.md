**WIP**

A js code generate platform.  It parse a graph to a js file. 

For macos only, now. 



## how to build

### install dep

Some dependdencies is in the `dependdencies ` folder, but some not.

So, first we should update the `dependdencies ` folder. 

Use command `git submodule update --init` for that.

**Mac**

```shell
brew install v8
brew install yaml-cpp
brew install libuv
brew install abseil
```
